**[Anshul](https://github.com/raun)** grew up in New Delhi and honed his chops at 3 e-commerce companies before getting into business of creating content. If you're interested in distributed/parallel systems, software-design, big data or upcoming storage technologies, you can trust him to find you in a crowded room. Other than this, he spends his free time on TV, Quora and gulping down food he has never tried before.

**Fun Fact**: Anshul can sleep for more than 24 hours straight

**Learning Now**: Blogging, Kotlin & Cooperative Multitasking
